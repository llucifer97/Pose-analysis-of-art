## Project Description

This is my [Google Summer of Code 2019](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#4647330802827264) Project with [Red Hen Lab](http://www.redhenlab.org/).

The goal of this project is to extract and analyze the Body   ​ Gesture and   ​ Pose of the people,   artwork, and sculptures of the medieval period. Interpreted the scenes depicted in the paintings.   Along with that,   I will also analyze    ​ .the           ​ emotion   depicted   in   the   images.
