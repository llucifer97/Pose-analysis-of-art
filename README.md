### Project Description

This is my [Google Summer of Code 2019](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#4647330802827264) Project with [Red Hen Lab](http://www.redhenlab.org/).

The goal of this project is to extract and analyze the Body   ​ Gesture and   ​ Pose of the people,   artwork, and sculptures of the medieval period. Interpreted the scenes depicted in the paintings.   Along with that,   I will also analyze    ​ .the           ​ emotion   depicted   in   the   images.

Project Mentors: [Peter Bell](https://uni-erlangen.academia.edu/PeterBell), [Leonardo Impett](http://www.biblhertz.it/en/institute/staff/staffdatabase/staff-details/ma-leonardo-impett/).

### Goals
*Week 1 - 4*
- [ ] Pre-process and annotate the data.
- [ ] Visualize the data and the different gesture captured from the data.
- [ ] Build a neural net based model for gesture classification
- [ ] Documentaion of the work done so far.


*Week 5 - 8*
- [ ] Prepare the baseline model for emotion classification
- [ ] Annotate the data based on emotion.
- [ ] Build machine learning based model for emotion classification

*Week 9 - 12*
